### 📚 Collecting Data:
The dataset was provided in the file **[Vrinda_Store_original.xlsx](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anmmashud/Vrinda_Store_Data_Analysis_Excel/main/Vrinda_Store_oriiginal.xlsx)**

### ❓ Sample Questions:
Here are some questions to guide the analysis:
1. 📈 How do sales compare to orders in a single chart?  
2. 🌄 Which month had the highest 📈 sales and orders?  
3. 💃 Did men or women purchase more in 2022?  
4. 🔎 What were the different order statuses in 2022?  
5. 🌎 Which 10 states contributed the most to sales?  
6. 🌀 How are age ⏳ and gender 👩👨 related to order numbers?  
7. 🌐 Which sales channel contributed the most revenue?  
8. 🎪 Which category had the highest 💸 sales?

### 🧰 Data Cleaning:
1. **🔢 Transforming the data into a table:**
   The data was turned into a table to enable filters and make it easier to analyze. (You can also activate filters using **Alt + D + F**, but tables are more reliable.)

2. **🧠 Checking for anomalies:**
   I checked for blank or null cells. Luckily, none were found. If there were any, they would have been ❇ excluded using the filter options.

3. **🏛️ Standardizing gender entries:**
   The gender column had inconsistent entries (Men, M, W, Women). These were standardized into two categories: **Men** and **Women**.

</div>

### ⚙️ Data Processing:
To address trends over time, a new column was added to extract the 🔢 month from the Date column.

### 🔝 Data Analysis:
Analysis steps include the use of 📈 charts, pivot tables, and calculations to answer the questions and uncover trends. ✨✨✨

- **📈 Bar Charts:**
  - Orders vs. Sales  
  - Top 10 States by Sales  
  - Age vs. Gender Orders  

- **🔹 Pie Charts:**
  - Order Status  
  - Channel Contribution  
  - Gender Comparison (Men vs. Women)  

- **🔂 Slicers:**
