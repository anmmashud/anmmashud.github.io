# Retail Sales Analysis SQL Project 1

## Project Overview

**Project Title**: Retail Sales Analysis  
**Level**: Beginner  
**Database**: `p1_retail_db`

This project demonstrates SQL skills and techniques commonly used by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyze retail sales data. It involves setting up a retail sales database, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and answering specific business questions through SQL queries. This project is ideal for beginners looking to build a solid foundation in SQL.
## Objectives

1. **Set up a retail sales database**: Create and populate a retail sales database using the provided sales data.

2. **Data Cleaning**: Identify and remove any records with missing or null values.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.

4. **Business Analysis**: Use SQL to answer specific business questions and derive actionable insights.

## Project Structure

### 1. **Database Setup**

- **Database Creation**: Create a database named `p1_retail_db`.

- **Table Creation**: A table named `retail_sales` is created to store the sales data. The table structure includes columns for transaction ID, sale date, sale time, customer ID, gender, age, product category, quantity sold, price per unit, cost of goods sold (COGS), and total sale amount.

```sql

DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS p1_retail_db;

CREATE DATABASE p1_retail_db;

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS retail_sales;

CREATE TABLE retail_sales
(
    transactions_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    sale_date DATE,
    sale_time TIME,
    customer_id INT,
    gender VARCHAR(15),
    age INT,
    category VARCHAR(15),
    quantity INT,
    price_per_unit FLOAT,
    cogs FLOAT,
    total_sale FLOAT
);
```

**Create Database**

```sql
CREATE DATABASE p1_retail_db;
```

**Drop Table if it exists**

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS retail_sales;
```

**Create Table**

```sql
CREATE TABLE retail_sales
(
    transactions_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    sale_date DATE,
    sale_time TIME,
    customer_id INT,
    gender VARCHAR(15),
    age INT,
    category VARCHAR(15),
    quantity INT,
    price_per_unit FLOAT,
    cogs FLOAT,
    total_sale FLOAT
);
```
</details>

### 2. **Data Exploration & Cleaning**

**Import Data from the CSV file:** [Download SQL_Retail_Sales_Analysis.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anmmashud/Retail_Sales_Analysis_SQL_Project_1/main/SQL_Retail_Sales_Analysis.csv)

- **Record Count**: Determine the total number of records in the dataset.

- **Customer Count**: Find the number of unique customers.

- **Category Count**: Identify all unique product categories.

- **Null Value Check**: Check for any null values in the dataset and delete records with missing data.

```sql
-- Identify Rows with Null Values
SELECT * 
FROM retail_sales
WHERE transactions_id IS NULL
   OR sale_date IS NULL
   OR sale_time IS NULL
   OR customer_id IS NULL
   OR gender IS NULL
   OR age IS NULL
   OR category IS NULL
   OR quantity IS NULL
   OR price_per_unit IS NULL
   OR cogs IS NULL
   OR total_sale IS NULL;
-- Delete Rows with Null Values
DELETE FROM retail_sales
WHERE transactions_id IS NULL
   OR sale_date IS NULL
   OR sale_time IS NULL
   OR customer_id IS NULL
   OR gender IS NULL
   OR age IS NULL
   OR category IS NULL
   OR quantity IS NULL
   OR price_per_unit IS NULL
   OR cogs IS NULL
   OR total_sale IS NULL;
```

**Display Sample Data**

To check if all data imported successfully
```sql
SELECT * FROM retail_sales LIMIT 10;
```

**Count Rows in the Table**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM retail_sales;
```
here we have 2000 rows (if you use the given file with the project)

**Identify Rows with Null Values**

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM retail_sales
WHERE transactions_id IS NULL
   OR sale_date IS NULL
   OR sale_time IS NULL
   OR customer_id IS NULL
   OR gender IS NULL
   OR age IS NULL
   OR category IS NULL
   OR quantity IS NULL
   OR price_per_unit IS NULL
   OR cogs IS NULL
   OR total_sale IS NULL;
```

**Delete Rows with Null Values**

```sql
DELETE FROM retail_sales
WHERE transactions_id IS NULL
   OR sale_date IS NULL
   OR sale_time IS NULL
   OR customer_id IS NULL
   OR gender IS NULL
   OR age IS NULL
   OR category IS NULL
   OR quantity IS NULL
   OR price_per_unit IS NULL
   OR cogs IS NULL
   OR total_sale IS NULL;
```
</details>

### Data Exploration (After Cleaning)

**1. How many sales are there?**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_sales FROM retail_sales;
```
*Alternative approach*
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT transactions_id) AS total_sales FROM retail_sales;
```
`Ans:` 1987

**2. How many unique customers are there?**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS total_customers FROM retail_sales;
```
`Ans:` 155

**3. How many categories are there?**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT category) AS total_categories FROM retail_sales;
```
`Ans:` 3

**4. What are the unique categories?**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT category FROM retail_sales;
```
`Ans:` Electronics, Clothing, Beauty

### 3. **Data Analysis & Business Queries**

The following SQL queries were developed to answer specific business questions:

**1. Write a SQL query to Retrieve all columns for sales made on 2022-11-05**

`Ans:`
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM retail_sales
WHERE sale_date = '2022-11-05';
```

**2. Write a SQL query to Retrieve all transactions where the category is 'Clothing', quantity sold is more than 4, in November 2022**

`Ans:`
```sql
SELECT *
FROM retail_sales
WHERE category = 'Clothing'
	AND quantity >= 4
	AND TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM') = '2022-11';

SELECT *
FROM retail_sales
WHERE total_sale > 1000;
```
`Output:` 
Hint: 306 Rows

SELECT 
    TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM') AS year_month,
    AVG(total_sale) AS average_sale,
    SUM(total_sale) AS total_monthly_sale
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM')
ORDER BY SUM(total_sale) DESC;
```
`Output:` 
Hint: 24 Rows

---

**8. Write a SQL query to Find the top 5 customers based on the highest total sales**

`Ans:`
```sql
SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_sale) AS total_sales
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
`Output:` 
Customer ID : 3 > 1 > 5 > 2 > 4

---

**9. Write a SQL query to Find the number of unique customers who purchased items from each category**

`Ans:`
```sql
SELECT category, COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS unique_customers
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category;
```
`Output:` Beauty = 141, Clothing = 149, Electronics = 144

---

**10. Write a SQL query to create each shift and number of orders (Example Morning <12, Afternoon Between 12 & 17, Evening >17)**

`Ans:`
```sql
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) < 12 THEN 'Morning'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon'
        ELSE 'Evening'
    END AS shift,
    COUNT(transactions_id) AS total_orders
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY 
    CASE 
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) < 12 THEN 'Morning'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon'
        ELSE 'Evening'
    END;
```
`Output:`
