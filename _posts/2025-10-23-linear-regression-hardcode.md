## Sidenotes

Distill supports sidenotes, which are like footnotes but placed in the margin of the page.
They are useful for providing additional context or references without interrupting the flow of the main text.

There are two main ways to create a sidenote:

**Using the `<aside>` tag:**

## Test

The following code creates a sidenote with **_distill's styling_** in the margin:

```html
<aside><p>This is a sidenote using aside tag.</p></aside>
```

<aside><p> This is a sidenote using `&lt;aside&gt;` tag</p> </aside>

We can also add images to sidenotes (click on the image to zoom in for a larger version):
{% raw %}

```html
<aside>
  {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/rhino.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
  <p>
    F.J. Cole, “The History of Albrecht Dürer’s Rhinoceros in Zoological Literature,” Science, Medicine, and History: Essays on the Evolution of
    Scientific Thought and Medical Practice (London, 1953), ed. E. Ashworth Underwood, 337-356. From page 71 of Edward Tufte’s Visual Explanations.
  </p>
</aside>
```

{% endraw %}

<aside>
  {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/rhino.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
  <p>F.J. Cole, “The History of Albrecht Dürer’s Rhinoceros in Zoological Literature,” Science, Medicine, and History: Essays on the Evolution of Scientific Thought and Medical Practice (London, 1953), ed. E. Ashworth Underwood, 337-356. From page 71 of Edward Tufte’s Visual Explanations.</p>
</aside>

Sidenotes can also contain equations and links:

In physics, mass–energy equivalence is the relationship between mass and energy in a system's rest frame. The two differ only by a multiplicative constant and the units of measurement.

<aside>
  <p>This principle is defined by Einstein's famous equation: $E = mc^2$ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass%E2%80%93energy_equivalence" target="_blank">(Source: Wikipedia)</a></p>
