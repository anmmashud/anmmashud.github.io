# Installing Jupyter Notebook or Anaconda on Windows

This guide provides simple and effective instructions for installing Jupyter Notebook on a Windows system using Python. Alternatively, for a better experience, you can install **Anaconda** or **Miniconda**, which come with Jupyter and additional tools pre-installed. It also includes solutions for common issues during the installation process.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Python Installed**: Ensure Python is installed on your system if you plan to use Jupyter directly. If not, download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Operating System**: Windows 10 or later.

---

## Steps

### Option 1: Install Jupyter Notebook (If you only need Notebook)

1. Open your Command Prompt.
2. Run the following command to install Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   python -m pip install jupyter
   ```

   This command uses `pip` (Python's package installer) to download and install Jupyter Notebook.

---

### Option 2: Install Anaconda or Miniconda (Recommended)

1. **Visit the Download Pages**:
   - [Download Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)
   - [Download Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

2. **Choose the Right Installer**:
   - Select the installer suitable for your system (e.g., Windows 64-bit).
   - If you’re unsure which to choose, refer to the table below for guidance.

   **Comparison Between Anaconda and Miniconda**:

   | Feature                | Anaconda                                                                 | Miniconda                                                                 |
   |------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | **Includes conda**      | Yes                                                                      | Yes                                                                      |
   | **Includes Anaconda Navigator** | Yes                                                                      | No                                                                       |
   | **Number of Packages**  | Over 300                                                                 | Less than 70                                                              |
   | **Install Space Required** | Approximately 4.4 GB                                                     | Approximately 480 MB                                                     |

   **Recommendation**: 
   - Choose **Anaconda** for a ready-to-use environment with many pre-installed packages.
   - Choose **Miniconda** for a lightweight installation, adding only the packages you need.

3. **Run the Installer**:
   - After downloading the installer, double-click to run it.
   - Follow the on-screen instructions.

<summary><strong>Common Issues and Solutions</strong></summary>

1. **Theme Errors or Conflicting Packages**:
   - If you see an error like:

     ```
     AttributeError: module 'notebook.services.contents.filemanager' has no attribute 'themes'
     ```

     Or face other theme-related or package conflicts, follow these steps:

     1. Uninstall all Jupyter-related packages by running:

        ```bash
        pip uninstall jupyter jupyterlab notebook nbconvert nbformat
        ```

     2. Clear the pip cache to remove residual files:

        ```bash
        pip cache purge
        ```

     3. Reinstall Jupyter Notebook:

        ```bash
        python -m pip install jupyter
        ```

2. **'jupyter' is not recognized as an internal or external command**:
   - This error occurs when the Python Scripts folder is not in your system's PATH.
   - Solution:
     - Add the Python Scripts folder (e.g., `C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\PythonXX\Scripts`) to your system's PATH environment variable.
     - Restart your Command Prompt after making the changes.

3. **Outdated pip Version**:
   - An outdated pip version can cause installation problems.
   - Solution:
     - Upgrade pip by running:

       ```bash
       python -m pip install --upgrade pip
       ```

4. **Missing Dependencies**:
   - Missing dependencies can lead to incomplete installations.
   - Solution:
     - Install required dependencies with:

       ```bash
       python -m pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel
       ```

## Additional Notes

- **For Anaconda Users**: If you’re new to Python or Jupyter, Anaconda is the easiest way to get started. It includes Jupyter Notebook, Python, and numerous pre-installed libraries and tools for data science.
- **For Miniconda Users**: If you want more control over which packages are installed, Miniconda is a great option.
- Always ensure you are running the latest version of Python and pip.

For more information:
- [Anaconda Documentation](https://docs.anaconda.com/)
- [Miniconda Documentation](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
- [Jupyter Documentation](https://jupyter.org/)

By following these steps, you will have Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda, or Miniconda installed on your Windows system, ready for your data science and machine learning projects. Happy coding!

Python is a versatile programming language widely used in data analysis, web development, and more. This guide explains how to install the latest version of Python on Windows.

2. Double-click to run the installer.
3. Click **Install Now** for default settings or choose **Customize Installation** for advanced options.

#### **Step 3:** Verify Installation

1. After completion, open **Command Prompt**:
   - Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter.
   - Alternatively, press the Windows key on your keyboard, type `cmd`, and hit Enter.
2. Check the Python version:

```shell
python --version
```

3. Check the pip version:

```shell
pip --version
```

#### Step 4: Test Python

Open Python in Command Prompt:

```shell
python
```

Run a test command:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Output:

```plaintext
Hello, World!
```

Exit Python:

```python
exit()
```

Here are my screenshots. Don’t worry about the terminal color; you can customize it as well.
