**About Me**  

I'm **A.N.M. Mashud**, a passionate **Data Analyst**, deeply focused on turning raw data into meaningful, actionable insights. With hands-on experience in tools like `Python`,`SQL`, `Excel`,  and `Tableau`, I'm all about making complex data challenges simpler and more accessible.  
Currently, I serve as a Campus Ambassador for the **[NUSDF Bangladesh](https://nusdfbd.com)**, a **Brand Representative** at **[Interactive Cares](https://interactivecares.com)** and a **Volunteer** at the **[Bangladesh Red Crescent Society (BDRCS)](https://bdrcs.org)**.
I'm always exploring new ways to enhance my skills in data analysis, continuously learning and applying advanced techniques in **Statistical Analysis**, **Machine Learning**, and data science. My goal is to transform raw data into meaningful insights that drive informed decision-making.
Thank you...
