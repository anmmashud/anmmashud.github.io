I’m **A.N.M. Mashud**, an Aspiring **Data Scientist**, deeply focused on turning raw data into meaningful, actionable insights. With hands-on experience in tools like `Excel`, `SQL`, `Python`, I’m all about making complex data challenges simpler and more accessible.  


I’m always exploring new ways to enhance my skills in **Data Science** and **Machine Learning**, continuously learning and applying advanced techniques in statistical analysis, machine learning, and data science. My goal is to transform raw data into meaningful insights that drive informed decision-making.
