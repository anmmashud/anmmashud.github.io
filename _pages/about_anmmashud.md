I’m A.N.M. `Mashud`, a passionate `data scientist` and `researcher`, deeply focused on turning raw data into meaningful, actionable insights. With hands-on experience in tools like `Excel`, `SQL`, `Python`, and `Tableau`, I’m all about making complex data challenges simpler and more accessible.

Right now, I’m working on an exciting AI-driven model designed to help aspiring data analysts learn and grow. I’m always pushing myself to expand my expertise, diving deep into machine learning, data science, and statistical analysis.
